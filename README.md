📖 Project Overview
This project tackles flight delay prediction for global airlines, processing 11.6M+ flight records from flights.csv, airlines.csv, and airports.csv. It features:

A PySpark ML pipeline with Random Forest and Logistic Regression (AUC 0.7, F1 ~0.8), optimized for Google Colab’s free tier (12GB RAM).
Class imbalance handling using dynamic weights, improving precision from 0.85 to ~0.9.
Feature engineering including RouteFrequency, PrevDelay, IsWeekend, and IsPeakHour.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL queries for delay patterns by airline, month, and route.
Power BI dashboard with interactive maps, KPI cards, and slicers, visualizing delay predictions and business insights.
Business impact: Recommends operational improvements (e.g., scheduling adjustments) to save $10M+ annually by reducing delays 20%.

The pipeline processes big data efficiently, reducing runtime from 8 hours to 1.5 hours through sampling, checkpointing, and Spark tuning, making it ideal for enterprise-scale applications.

🎯 Key Features

💡 Business Insights

Top Delay Predictors: Previous delays (PrevDelay) and route frequency (RouteFrequency) are critical.
High-Risk Routes: Identified via EDA (e.g., frequent routes like JFK-LAX).
Recommendations:
Optimize peak-hour scheduling (7–9 AM, 5–7 PM) to reduce congestion.
Prioritize maintenance for high-frequency routes.
Estimated savings: $10M+ annually by reducing delays 20% (based on $74/delay minute).




🔧 Troubleshooting

Memory Errors: Reduce sample_fraction=0.05 (~580K rows) or use Colab Pro ($9.99/month).
Slow Runtime: Check pipeline.log; skip ROC curve or set numFolds=1.
FileNotFound: Verify /content/drive/MyDrive/flight_data/ for datasets and checkpoints.
Schema Issues: Check pipeline.log for printSchema() output; ensure probability is vector.
Power BI Errors: Ensure delay_probability is type Number in Transform Data.
